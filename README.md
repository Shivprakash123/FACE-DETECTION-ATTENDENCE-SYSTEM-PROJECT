# FACE-DETECTION-ATTENDENCE-SYSTEM-PROJECT

<h1>Desription:</h1>
In this project we are going to develop a face-recognition + attendance system which will recognize the face and diplay its name on webcam and note its attendance in a csv file. We have done the code in python language which contains some amazing libraries to detect the faces in an image. 

<h1>Libraries/Dependencies Used:</h1>
○ Numpy - a library for Python, adding support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, in conjunction with an enormous assortment of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


○ Datetime - It’s a combination of date and time along with the attributes year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond etc.

○ Face_Recognition - Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library.

○ OpenCV - a library of programming functions primarily geared toward real-time computer vision.

○ Dlib - C++ Library containing machine learning agorithms

○ os - a module in python which provides functions for interacting with the operation system
